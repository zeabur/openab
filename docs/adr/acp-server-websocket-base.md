## 1. Context

The original proposal ([acp-server-websocket.md](./acp-server-websocket.md)) defines
the full ACP-server vision across five phases. This ADR is the **as-built record of
the base** — the concrete, **wire-conformant** primitive surface the implementation
ships and that future work should follow.

Scope: a standard-ACP **1:1 chat** endpoint for real ACP clients (browser,
desktop, IDE, CLI) over WebSocket. Phase-1 returns each reply as a single terminal
`agent_message_chunk` (backend `streaming=false`); progressive multi-chunk streaming is
Phase-2 (§6). Client fs/terminal methods, multi-agent fan-out, and Streamable HTTP
remain outside the base; tool permission relay was added later as the opt-in extension
recorded in §6 and the reverse-MCP ADR.

Design goal (per decision on 2026-07-17): **follow the official ACP guide** so
third-party ACP clients (Zed, JetBrains, …) interoperate — no custom method names.

## 2. Decision — the base primitive surface (ACP-conformant)

Transport: `GET /acp`, feature-gated `acp` + runtime `OPENAB_ACP_ENABLED`. Mounted on
**both** the standalone `openab-gateway` binary (`serve()`) **and** the embedded
gateway of `openab run` (the unified binary) — so fleet deployments that run
`openab run` (not the standalone gateway) serve ACP too. The embedded HTTP server
starts whenever `OPENAB_ACP_ENABLED` is set (or any platform / `[gateway]` is
configured) — so an ACP-only deployment, or one whose only platform is Discord (which
the core connects to directly, without the webhook server), still binds the listener.
ACP replies are routed back via the unified adapter's `dispatch_reply`
(`platform == "acp"`).

**Two independent auth layers:**

1. **Transport** — a shared bearer key on the WS upgrade (`OPENAB_ACP_AUTH_KEY`,
   timing-safe compare via `subtle::ConstantTimeEq`). ACP itself defines **no**
   client→server transport auth (its reference transport is a local stdio subprocess, so
   the OS process boundary is the trust boundary); running ACP over a network is outside
   that model, so the transport key is an OpenAB addition. The key is presented, in
   priority order:
   1. **`Authorization: Bearer <key>`** — non-browser clients (cleanest).
   2. **`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: openab.bearer.<key>, acp.v1`** — the **browser** path:
      browsers cannot set an `Authorization` header on a WS handshake but can offer
      subprotocols via `new WebSocket(url, protocols)`. The server extracts the key from
      the `openab.bearer.` entry and echoes the real `acp.v1` subprotocol. This is the de
      facto browser-WS bearer pattern (as used by the Kubernetes API server) and keeps the
      key **out of the URL**.
   The `?token=<key>` query fallback was **removed** (R17-F2): a key in the URL leaks into
   access logs / browser history / referers, and the two header-borne sources above fully
   cover both non-browser and browser clients. Only those two carry the bearer; a request
   presenting a credential solely via the query string is rejected `401` in keyed mode.

   We deliberately do **not** repurpose ACP's `authenticate` / `authMethods` for this:
   those are agent→provider auth (the client helping a locally-spawned agent log in to its
   LLM, credential set out-of-band), not client→server, so a standard ACP client would
   misread them. `authMethods` stays `[]`.

   **Fail-open only on loopback:** if no key is set, `/acp` is mounted only when the server
   binds a loopback address (`127.0.0.0/8` / `::1` / `localhost`); a non-loopback bind
   (`0.0.0.0`, LAN, LoadBalancer) without a key refuses to mount the endpoint, so an
   unauthenticated agent endpoint is never exposed to the network. An empty key counts as
   unset.

   **Browser `Origin` gating in keyless mode:** a WS handshake is exempt from the browser
   same-origin policy, so a keyless `ws://127.0.0.1/acp` is otherwise reachable cross-origin
   by any web page the user has open. In keyless (loopback) mode the upgrade handler
   therefore inspects `Origin`: a browser-set `Origin` that is not allowlisted is rejected
   with `403`, while a request with no `Origin` (a non-browser client) is admitted. The
   allowlist is opt-in via `OPENAB_ACP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated exact origins) and
   defaults to empty — i.e. every browser origin is blocked until explicitly allowed. The
   keyed (bearer) path does not consult `Origin`; the transport key is the trust boundary
   there.
2. **Identity** — ACP events carry a fixed synthetic sender id `acp_client` and pass
   through the gateway trust registry (the `acp` platform is seeded there alongside
   telegram/line/…). Admit the sender with `GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true` or
   `GATEWAY_ALLOWED_USERS=acp_client`; otherwise every prompt is denied with a
   "request-access" echo. (These must be **process** env on the broker, not
   `[agent].env`.)

JSON-RPC 2.0; non-`"2.0"` rejected with `-32600`.

### Client → Agent (requests)

| Method | Params | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `initialize` | `{ protocolVersion: 1, clientCapabilities?, clientInfo? }` | `{ protocolVersion: 1, agentCapabilities, agentInfo, authMethods: [] }` |
| `session/new` | `{ cwd, mcpServers }` | `{ sessionId }` |
| `session/resume` | `{ sessionId, cwd, mcpServers? }` | `{}` (no history replay) |
| `session/prompt` | `{ sessionId, prompt: [ContentBlock] }` | `{ stopReason }` |

`agentCapabilities` advertises `sessionCapabilities.resume` (we support resume) and
`loadSession: false` (we cannot replay history — see §3). `promptCapabilities` are
all `false` in the base (text only). `protocolVersion` is the integer `1`.

### Client → Agent (notification)

| Method | Params | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `session/cancel` | `{ sessionId }` | one-way; in-flight prompt ends with `stopReason:"cancelled"`. No response. |

### Agent → Client (notification)

- `session/update` with `update.sessionUpdate = "agent_message_chunk"` and
  `update.content = { type:"text", text: <delta> }` — reply text. **Phase-1 delivers the
  whole reply as a single terminal `agent_message_chunk` before the `session/prompt`
  response** — the ACP `ChatAdapter` is `streaming=false`, so the backend hands the reply
  over once rather than incrementally. Progressive multi-chunk streaming is Phase-2 (§6).
  The delta is still sliced char-boundary-safe (`str::get`, never byte-index) so CJK /
  顏文字 / emoji cannot panic the stream if/when multiple chunks arrive.
- Turn completion is the `session/prompt` **response** (`{ stopReason }`, correlated
  to the request id), not a separate notification. `stopReason` ∈ `end_turn` /
  `cancelled`. A backend timeout has no ACP stopReason, so it returns a JSON-RPC
  error (`-32603`) instead.

### Concurrency, caps & reply fencing

- **Per-connection caps** — `MAX_SESSIONS_PER_CONNECTION` (128) and
  `MAX_INFLIGHT_PROMPTS` (32) bound one connection's growth; overflow returns `-32000`
  (`ACP_OVERLOADED`). The session cap is enforced on **both** `session/new` and
  `session/resume` — resume is not an unbounded insert path (a client can mint unlimited
  well-formed `sess_<uuid>`).
- **Stale-reply fencing** — after a prompt times out or is cancelled, the next prompt on
  the same session reuses the same deterministic `channel_id`. Each turn registers its
  reply sink under the originating `GatewayEvent` id (`evt_<uuid>`, round-tripped as
  `GatewayReply.reply_to`); `handle_reply` drops a reply whose `reply_to` no longer
  matches the active turn, so a late reply from the superseded turn cannot leak into the
  new prompt's stream.
- **Backend work is not yet cancelled** — the inflight cap counts *gateway* stream tasks,
  not downstream agent work. A timed-out / cancelled turn keeps running on the backend
  until it finishes on its own; a `prompt → cancel` loop can therefore queue backend work
  beyond the 32 cap. Bounding this needs true agent→core cancel propagation — tracked as a
  follow-up, not addressed in the base (the fence above still prevents its late output from
  corrupting a later turn).

### Session ↔ core mapping

- `sessionId = sess_<uuid>` and `channel_id = acp_<uuid>` share one uuid, so
  `channel_id` is always re-derivable from a persisted `sessionId`.
- Prompts become a `GatewayEvent` (`platform:"acp"`, `channel:acp_<uuid>`); core
  keys continuity by `session_key = acp:<channel_id>`.

## 3. Resume — why `session/resume`, not `session/load`

ACP distinguishes `session/load` (agent **replays** history via `session/update`,
then responds) from `session/resume` (restores context, **MUST NOT** replay). We
implement **`session/resume`**, decided against `crates/openab-core/src/acp/pool.rs`:

- The conversation history lives inside the **downstream** coding-agent CLI's session
  (claude / codex / kiro). The core only persists a `thread_key → agent sessionId`
  mapping — it does **not** hold a replayable upstream transcript. So the gateway
  cannot satisfy `session/load`'s replay contract; `loadSession: false`.
- Continuation still works: on the next prompt, core recovers the underlying agent
  session via its persisted mapping + downstream `session/load` (this survives a
  process restart, within the agent's retention / `session_ttl_hours`, default 4h).
- `resume` therefore restores context without replay; the **client** keeps its own
  transcript for display. `session/resume` returns `{}` immediately.

Whether the core session is still alive is **not observable** at the gateway — an
expired session silently starts fresh, and the core prefixes its first reply with a
"Session expired" notice the client can surface.

Security: `sessionId` is a server-minted, high-entropy capability; `session/resume`
requires a well-formed `sess_<uuid>`, keeping the channel inside the `acp_` namespace
and rejecting forged ids.

## 4. Divergences from the original proposal

| Proposal (the base) | As-built | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Add `agent-client-protocol` crate dep | removed — hand-rolled JSON-RPC | fewer deps; small surface |
| "Bearer token auth" | `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` + `OPENAB_ACP_AUTH_KEY` | timing-safe, no new dep |
| Resume in **Phase 3** | `session/resume` in **the base** | core continuity is already channel-keyed + persisted, so a gateway-only change buys reconnect resume cheaply |

## 5. Consequences & limits

- **1:1 only** — reply registry is `channel_id → single reply_tx`; the delta stream
  assumes one monotonic text. This matches ACP's 1:1 nature (one client ↔ one agent) and
  is correct. Multi-agent "conversation" (Discord-style) is NOT fan-out and NOT an ACP
  concern: it is N independent OpenAB instances, each its own `/acp` connection, relayed
  by the client acting as the shared room (see §6, Not needed).
- **OpenAB command parity is mostly free** — control directives (`[[ws]]`, `[[model]]`, …)
  and slash commands (`/reset`, `/model`, …) are message-text conventions parsed
  platform-agnostically (`openab-core`), so they already work over ACP when the client
  includes them in a prompt — no ACP-specific work required. **Verified by construction:**
  directives go through `directives::parse_directives` in `dispatch.rs` (no platform gating);
  `/reset` and `/model` are intercepted in `process_gateway_event` (and the `run_gateway_adapter`
  path), both keyed on `event.platform` generically — nothing special-cases `acp` out, and the
  interception reads `event.content.text`, which for ACP is the prompt text the client sends.
  The one runtime item left to confirm on a live agent is whether a slash command's
  *confirmation* reply (`send_fire_and_forget`) renders back into the ACP client's stream —
  folded into the deploy-gated e2e re-verify. A typed UI for them (`authenticate` /
  `available_commands_update`) is an optional later nicety.
- **cwd / mcpServers** — accepted on `session/new` / `session/resume` for wire
  conformance but **deliberately not propagated** into the agent working dir in the base.
  This is a security decision, not just a TODO: the downstream plumbing already exists
  (`openab-core` `pool.get_or_create(working_dir_override)`), but its only source is the
  `[[ws:…]]` message-text directive, resolved by `resolve_workspace` which **contains every
  path under the bot's home** (`canonical_target.starts_with(bot_home)`, must exist, must be
  a dir). Honoring a raw client-supplied `cwd` as the process `current_dir` would bypass that
  containment — unacceptable for an endpoint that is **unauthenticated by default** (§2). And
  for the base's real clients (a browser side-panel) `cwd` is meaningless: they don't know a
  valid pod-side path under `bot_home`, so it would fall back to the config default anyway.
  When it is actually wanted (an authenticated IDE-style client), the safe wiring is to route
  the ACP `cwd` **through** the same `resolve_workspace` containment (arbitrary paths rejected,
  only existing dirs under `bot_home` honored) — not straight into `current_dir`.
- **Emoji** — inline 顏文字 flow through as text; reaction emoji stay no-op in the base.
- **Reconnect** — on WS disconnect the per-connection session map is dropped; the
  client reconnects with `session/resume` + its persisted `sessionId`.

## 6. Roadmap (re-scoped; not the original proposal's numbered phases)

North star: the agent's LLM autonomously operating the user's real browser (generalized
"computer use") — see [Reverse MCP-over-ACP over WebSocket](./acp-server-websocket-reverse-mcp.md).

### Critical path (next) — everything the browser goal requires
> **Done in #1447** — all four items below shipped (agent→client request direction, the
> MCP-over-ACP tunnel + the core-side capability source, and the generated v1 wire types). That
> source was called the "core MCP proxy" while a per-session proxy existed; both the proxy and the
> stdio bridge were removed in the same PR. See the
> [Reverse MCP-over-ACP ADR](./acp-server-websocket-reverse-mcp.md).
- **agent→client REQUEST direction** — the base does only client→agent + agent→client
  *notifications*; browser/tool use needs the agent to send *requests* to the client and
  await a result. The WS is already bidirectional; the dispatch loop must add this path.
- **`session/request_permission`** — tool-use approval. Shipped as an explicit per-session opt-in:
  `_meta["dev.openab/permissionPolicy"] = "relay"`; the legacy default remains auto-approve.
- **MCP-over-ACP tunnel + OpenAB core as MCP proxy** — the extension exposes browser
  tools (MCP server role over its outbound WS); core proxies them to the in-pod agent.
- **Generated typed wire types (v1)** — decided for the base: adopt offline codegen
  (typify → plain serde, no `schemars` dep) rather than hand-rolling the expanded
  bidirectional surface. Currently hand-rolled; migration planned (validate round-trip
  against real traffic first).

### Optional (as-needed, off the critical path)
- **`tool_call` / `tool_call_update` display** — a client-facing tool-activity display
  (e.g. a distinct "tool chip" per call with running/done/failed state). *State today:* the
  downstream tool events reach the ACP client only **merged into the text** — `openab-core`
  parses them into `AcpEvent::ToolStart` / `ToolDone`, then `compose_display` prepends
  "🔧 …" lines onto the reply text buffer that streams as `agent_message_chunk`; there is
  no structured separation over `/acp`. *Recommended approach:* for the `acp` platform, tap
  the `AcpEvent::ToolStart` / `ToolDone` stream **before** the `compose_display` merge and
  emit structured `session/update` `tool_call` / `tool_call_update` notifications (with
  `toolCallId` / `title` / `status`) separately from the text — this is the ACP-native path
  (standard clients like Zed render it too), avoids brittle client-side text parsing, and
  cleanly separates tool activity from the answer. Client (extension) then renders chips.
- **Progressive `agent_message_chunk` streaming (Phase-2)** — Phase-1 emits the whole reply
  as one terminal chunk because the ACP `ChatAdapter` reports `streaming=false`, so the
  backend hands the reply over once. True incremental delivery — flip the adapter to
  streaming and emit a chunk per delta as the backend produces text — is Phase-2; the
  gateway's char-boundary-safe delta path already tolerates multiple chunks.
- other richer `session/update` variants: `agent_thought_chunk` / `plan` /
  `available_commands_update` / `usage_update`
- `fs/*`, `terminal/*` (sibling agent→client capabilities)
- `ContentBlock` image / audio / resource (image only if screenshot-based browser tools)
- session admin: `session/close` / `list` / `delete`, `set_mode` / `set_config_option`,
  `session/load` (history replay — needs an upstream transcript store)
- typed command UI: `authenticate`, `available_commands_update` advertisement
- **Streamable HTTP** transport (POST + SSE on `/acp`) — only for environments where
  WebSocket is not viable (serverless, aggressive proxies); not needed for local/WS use
- multiple sessions per connection

### Not needed (removed from scope)
- **Multi-agent fan-out / ensemble** — Discord-style multi-agent is N independent OpenAB
  instances relayed by the client (a "room"): client-side orchestration, no ACP fan-out.
  ACP is 1:1; fan-out would only produce a single-agent "ensemble" answer, which is not a
  goal (you want to *see* the separate agents, not merge them).

### Observability (recommended first, low-risk)
- An **ACP trace mode** (flag-gated, both directions/hops) to record real ACP traffic —
  reveals the variant surface downstream agents actually emit, informs which of the
  Optional variants to forward, and validates the generated-type round-trip.

## 7. Typing & dependency decision (as-built: generated types vendored; trivial payloads hand-rolled + conformance-pinned)

Both sides of OpenAB's ACP started **hand-rolled, untyped** (`serde_json::Value` + manual
string matching on `sessionUpdate` variants): the upstream server here (~740 lines, chat
only) and the downstream client in `openab-core/src/acp/` (`protocol.rs` + `connection.rs`,
~1800 lines, many variants). Hand-rolling caused the exact conformance bugs fixed during the
base build (`agentMessageChunk`→`agent_message_chunk`, `stopReason` snake_case, integer
`protocolVersion: 1`).

**As-built (this PR).** The generated types now exist and are committed, but the switch was
made surgically per the rule below rather than as a blanket rewrite:

- **Generated types vendored + committed** — `crates/openab-gateway/src/adapters/acp_schema.rs`
  (feature-gated `acp`), produced by `cargo-typify 0.7.0` from the vendored ACP v1 schema
  (`crates/openab-gateway/schemas/acp-v1.schema.json`, pinned to upstream `schema.json`
  @ `eb88e992` / ACP Schema v1.19.0). Plain serde, **0** `schemars`/`serde_with` in the
  generated body (verified). The full v1 surface is generated (one closed dep graph — a
  hand-trimmed subset would not be meaningfully smaller and would diverge from the schema);
  the remainder beyond the chat subset is inert `dead_code` until the roadmap consumes it.
- **Trivial chat payloads stay hand-rolled** (`json!`) — they are correct and readable, and
  the typify construction ergonomics for them are poor (`AgentCapabilities` has no `Default`;
  `ContentBlock` is an untagged `VariantN`). Per the rule, we did **not** churn them into
  builder chains.
- **Conformance is pinned, not asserted by construction** — the `acp_conformance` test module
  in `acp_server.rs` deserializes every hand-rolled payload the server emits/accepts through
  the generated types and proves serde is a stable fixed point. Any casing/field/shape drift
  (the original bug class) now fails CI. This is the round-trip validation §6 called for.
- **Full typed *construction* migration is deferred** to the bidirectional / MCP-over-ACP
  surface (roadmap §6 Critical path), where hand-rolling actually breaks and the generated
  types earn their keep. The trivial base does not need it.

Options weighed for typing the wire:

| Option | New deps | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Hand-roll (current) | 0 | Fine for the trivial chat subset; error-prone for the big bidirectional surface |
| Full `agent-client-protocol` crate | ~105 (incl. a 2nd async runtime, async-io/smol) | **Never** — connection/role machinery unneeded (we have our own WS + GatewayEvent bridge) |
| `agent-client-protocol-schema` (types) | **+24** (measured 376→400), schemars-dominated | schemars is for `JsonSchema` derive we don't use at runtime; `serde_with`/`strum` mandatory (no feature to drop); floor is fixed |
| **Offline codegen (typify) → committed serde-only `.rs`** | **~0 runtime** | **Chosen & shipped** — `acp_schema.rs` generated + committed; typed conformance without the schemars tree |

Notes:
- **v1 only.** `v2` is experimental (`unstable_protocol_v2`, adds `diffy`), currently
  wire-identical to v1, "may change at any time". We negotiate `protocolVersion 1`.
- **Caveat (resolved for the chat subset):** ACP types lean on `serde_with` (MaybeUndefined
  tri-state, ~600 uses across the crate's v1 source), so a naive vendor-and-strip-`JsonSchema`
  is not clean and typify's plain-serde output must be **round-trip validated**. For the chat
  subset this is now **done** — the PoC and the `acp_conformance` test show the generated types
  round-trip the real wire exactly, with **no** `serde_with`/MaybeUndefined divergence (the one
  nuance: typify materializes schema-default capability booleans explicitly, which is
  semantically identical). Advanced bidirectional variants still warrant the same check via the
  §6 ACP trace mode before they are wired.
- **Rule:** hand-roll only the trivial; **generate the complex.** The switch point is the
  bidirectional/MCP surface. Highest ROI if unifying: the downstream core client
  (~1800 lines of manual variant matching), not this small upstream server.
