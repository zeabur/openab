# ACP — Official Method Surface & OpenAB Coverage

Reference list of the **official** Agent Client Protocol methods/notifications, and
how OpenAB's base ACP server (`docs/adr/acp-server-websocket-base.md`) maps onto
them. The base targets **wire conformance** for the chat subset, so standard ACP
clients (Zed, JetBrains, …) interoperate.

### Provenance / version pin

This table is built against a specific ACP revision — pin it so future diffs are
traceable:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Spec docs | <https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/overview>, <https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/schema> |
| Governance repo | <https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol> |
| **Schema release** | **v1.19.0** (latest on GitHub releases as of fetch date) |
| **Rust crate release** | **v1.4.0** |
| Fetched | 2026-07-17 |
| Wire `protocolVersion` | integer **`1`** (single MAJOR version, negotiated at `initialize`) |

> When re-checking conformance later, bump this block to the new Schema/crate release
> and re-diff the tables below.

Directions use the ACP roles: the **Agent** answers prompts (here, OpenAB); the
**Client** is the app/UI (browser, Zed, CLI).

## Agent methods (Client → Agent, request/response)

| Method | Purpose | OpenAB base |
|---|---|---|
| `initialize` | Negotiate protocol + capabilities | ✅ conformant (`protocolVersion:1`, `agentCapabilities`, `authMethods:[]`) |
| `authenticate` | Authenticate via a declared auth method | ⛔ (we use a pre-connect token on the WS upgrade; `authMethods:[]`) |
| `logout` | Drop authenticated state | ⛔ |
| `session/new` | Create a new session | ✅ (`{cwd, mcpServers}` accepted; returns `{sessionId}`) |
| `session/load` | Load a session **with** history replay | ⛔ **by design** — `loadSession:false` (no upstream transcript to replay; see ADR §3) |
| `session/resume` | Resume a session **without** replay | ✅ (`{sessionId, cwd, mcpServers?}` → `{}`) |
| `session/prompt` | Process a user prompt | ✅ (streams `session/update`, returns `{stopReason}`) |
| `session/close` | Close a session | ⛔ (cleanup on WS disconnect) |
| `session/list` | List known sessions | ⛔ |
| `session/delete` | Delete a session | ⛔ |
| `session/set_config_option` | Set a session config option | ⛔ |
| `session/set_mode` | Set the session mode | ⛔ |

## Notifications

| Method | Direction | Purpose | OpenAB base |
|---|---|---|---|
| `session/cancel` | Client → Agent | Cancel in-flight work (one-way, no response) | ⚠️ partial — the one-way notification is accepted and the gateway waiter ends with `stopReason:"cancelled"`, but cancellation is **not propagated to the backend** agent/model, which keeps running. Backend-propagating cancel is a tracked follow-up (review F3). |
| `session/update` | Agent → Client | Stream session events | ✅ `agent_message_chunk` (text). Other variants (`agent_thought_chunk`, `tool_call`, `tool_call_update`, `plan`, `available_commands_update`, `usage_update`, …) are Phase 2 / not forwarded |
| `$/cancel_request` | Bidirectional | Cancel an in-flight JSON-RPC request | ⚠️ sent by the permission relay when its client request times out; general inbound cancellation is not implemented |

## Client methods (Agent → Client, request/response)

The agent runs server-side with its own fs/terminal, so OpenAB does not call the
client fs/terminal methods. Permission relay is the explicit opt-in exception.

| Method | Purpose | OpenAB base |
|---|---|---|
| `session/request_permission` | Ask the client to approve a tool call | ✅ opt-in per session with `_meta["dev.openab/permissionPolicy"]:"relay"`; omitted policy preserves legacy auto-approve |
| `fs/read_text_file` / `fs/write_text_file` | Read/write a text file on the client | ⛔ |
| `terminal/create` / `output` / `wait_for_exit` / `kill` / `release` | Drive a client terminal | ⛔ |

## Conformance status (base)

The chat subset is **wire-conformant** with ACP Schema v1.19.0:

- `initialize` → integer `protocolVersion:1`, official `agentCapabilities` shape
  (`sessionCapabilities.resume`, `loadSession:false`, `promptCapabilities`), `authMethods:[]`.
- Streaming → `session/update` + `sessionUpdate:"agent_message_chunk"` + `content` ContentBlock.
- `stopReason` → official snake_case (`end_turn` / `cancelled`).
- `session/cancel` → one-way notification.
- Resume → `session/resume` (no replay), gated by `sessionCapabilities.resume`.

### Intentional non-support (documented, not a gap to close in the base)

- **`session/load`** — needs an upstream conversation transcript OpenAB does not keep
  (history lives in the downstream agent CLI). Advertised as `loadSession:false`.
- **`authenticate`/`logout`, ContentBlock non-text, tool-call updates,
  fs/terminal, session admin (`list`/`delete`/config/mode)** —
  deferred to later phases per the roadmap.

### Live verification status

- **Verified end-to-end (2026-07-17; re-checked 2026-07-18)** — the chat subset
  (`initialize` → `session/new` / `session/resume` → `session/prompt` → streamed
  `session/update` `agent_message_chunk` → `{stopReason}`) drives a real backend
  (cursor-agent) and streams replies to a WebSocket client (a Chrome side-panel
  extension + a raw `ws` client). `scripts/acp-ws-smoke.py` reproduces this.
- **Known limits (verified 2026-07-18; tracked follow-ups, not yet fixed)** —
  - **Long replies truncate.** A reply larger than the adapter's message limit is
    split into several messages, but the ACP reply route is closed after the first
    one, so overflow chunks are dropped (a 900-line reply arrived as ~413 lines).
    Review F2.
  - **Cancel does not stop the backend.** `session/cancel` returns
    `stopReason:"cancelled"` to the waiter, but the downstream model/tool work
    continues. Review F3.
- **Still unverified** — field-level exactness of `agentCapabilities` /
  `clientCapabilities` sub-objects against a *third-party* ACP client (e.g. Zed), and
  `ContentBlock` variants beyond `text` (image / audio / resource).

### Unified runtime session configuration

The unified binary advertises `agentCapabilities._meta["dev.openab/sessionConfig"]`
when the session configuration bridge is installed. Clients can read an **existing,
idle inner session** with `_openab/session/config_options` (`{sessionId}`), and set a
runtime-advertised string selection using ACP `session/set_config_option`
(`{sessionId, configId, value}`). Both return `{configOptions}` from the inner agent.
The session ID is the same opaque resume capability; it can be used on a control-only
connection after `initialize`, without taking over that session's output sink.

Neither method creates/resumes an inner session or starts a model turn. A dormant
session returns `-32004`, a busy session `-32005`, an invalid selection `-32602`, and
an unconfirmed agent write `-32603`. The standalone gateway without the bridge returns
`-32601`. Notification-shaped requests are ignored. Unlike interactive slash-command
handling, API writes never fall back to prompts or synthesize a successful selection.
Only select/string options are exposed (the inner initialize does not advertise boolean
configuration support). Available options and effort/Fast support remain agent-owned.

### Restoring configuration after idle eviction or restart

`_openab/session/config_options` accepts an optional `restore` object containing
`cwd`, `mcpServers`, and `_meta`. With ACP passthrough enabled this loads only a
known, persisted native session before returning its configuration. It never
creates a new conversation, sends a prompt, or installs an output sink. Unknown
sessions and rejected native loads fail without replacing the saved mapping.
Supply fresh session-scoped context; clients must authorize the session owner
before requesting restoration. Ordinary reads retain their existing behavior.
