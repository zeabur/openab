# Codex

Codex uses the [@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/codex-acp) adapter for ACP support.
The recommended working directory for the Codex image is `/home/node`; this is
also the container `HOME`, so Codex auth, sessions, generated images, and skills
live under `/home/node/.codex/`.

## Docker Image

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.codex -t openab-codex:latest .
```

The image installs `@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp` and `@openai/codex`
globally in the same npm transaction. The global Codex CLI keeps
`codex login --device-auth` available, while npm deduplicates the adapter's
compatible Codex dependency to the pinned CLI version.

For containerized deployments where the outer container or VM is the security
boundary, set `[pool] default_config_options = { mode = "agent-full-access" }`
— see [ACP Modes and Migration](#acp-modes-and-migration).

## Helm Install

```bash
helm install openab openab/openab \
  --set agents.kiro.enabled=false \
  --set agents.codex.discord.enabled=true \
  --set agents.codex.discord.botToken="$DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" \
  --set-string 'agents.codex.discord.allowedChannels[0]=YOUR_CHANNEL_ID' \
  --set agents.codex.workingDir=/home/node \
  --set image.tag=beta
```

> Set `agents.kiro.enabled=false` to disable the default Kiro agent.

### Image Tag

Use `--set image.tag=<version>` to set the image version globally.
The chart auto-appends `-<agent>` to produce the final tag (see [image-tags.md](image-tags.md) for full details).

| Tag | Resolves to | Description |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| `beta` | `beta-codex` | Floating beta channel (latest pre-release) |
| `0.9.0-beta.2` | `0.9.0-beta.2-codex` | Pinned to exact version |
| `0.9` | `0.9-codex` | Latest patch in minor (floating) |
| `stable` | `stable-codex` | Floating stable channel |

To override a single agent's image instead of the global tag:
```bash
--set agents.codex.image=ghcr.io/openabdev/openab:beta-codex
```

> ⚠️ There is no `latest` tag. Use `beta` or `stable`, or pin to an exact version.

## Manual config.toml

```toml
[agent]
# command defaults from the image's OPENAB_AGENT_COMMAND
# Only override if you need non-default behavior
```

## Authentication

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/openab-codex -- sh -c "$OPENAB_AGENT_AUTH_COMMAND"
```

Follow the device code flow in your browser, then restart the pod:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/openab-codex
```

## ACP Modes and Migration

The adapter exposes three ACP modes. The selected mode controls the sandbox
and approval policy for each ACP turn:

| Mode | Sandbox | Approval policy | Network |
|------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| `read-only` | read-only | on-request | disabled |
| `agent` (adapter default) | workspace-write | on-request | disabled |
| `agent-full-access` (recommended for OpenAB deployments) | danger-full-access | never | enabled |

The adapter defaults to `agent`. For OpenAB deployments the outer container or
VM is normally the intended security boundary, and Codex's inner sandbox needs
`bubblewrap` (user namespaces) that containers typically don't grant — so the
**recommended deployment default** is `agent-full-access`, set through the
standard ACP config option mechanism:

```toml
[pool]
default_config_options = { mode = "agent-full-access" }
```

OpenAB sends this after `session/new` on the ACP session, so it is explicit,
visible in config, and overridable per deployment — nothing is baked into the
image. `agent-full-access` removes Codex's inner sandbox and approval prompts;
it can read or modify mounted files and use the container's network. Use it
only with a dedicated outer isolation boundary. Avoid host filesystem and
Docker socket mounts, and scope mounted credentials, persistent volumes,
service accounts, and network access to the agent's actual needs. Select
`agent` or `read-only` when those conditions are not met.

> The adapter also honors an `INITIAL_AGENT_MODE` environment variable, but
> OpenAB spawns agents with a cleared environment, and packing it into
> `OPENAB_AGENT_COMMAND` via `/usr/bin/env` breaks configs that override
> `[agent].args` only. Prefer the `[pool]` mechanism above; if you need the
> env route, deliver it with `[agent] env = { INITIAL_AGENT_MODE = "…" }`.

> [!WARNING]
> **Breaking change — mode IDs renamed.** The previous Zed adapter used `auto`
> and `full-access`; this adapter uses `agent` and `agent-full-access`. OpenAB
> does **not** translate the old values: a `[pool].default_config_options`
> entry like `mode = "full-access"` fails to apply on upgrade (OpenAB logs
> `failed to set default config option` and the session stays on the adapter's
> conservative `agent` default — it fails safe, never escalates). Update your
> config to the new IDs:
>
> ```text
> auto        -> agent
> full-access -> agent-full-access
> ```

> [!WARNING]
> **Breaking change — `-c` CLI overrides are silently ignored.** The Zed
> adapter accepted Codex-style `-c key=value` arguments (e.g.
> `[agent] args = ["-c", "model=\"gpt-5.5\""]` to pin a model). This adapter's
> CLI only recognizes `--version`, `login`, and `cli` — anything else is
> ignored without error, so a carried-over model pin silently stops applying.
> Pin the model through the ACP config option instead:
>
> ```toml
> [pool]
> default_config_options = { mode = "agent-full-access", model = "gpt-5.5" }
> ```

Custom ACP clients that call `session/set_config_option` directly must also send
the new mode IDs. If canary validation finds a regression, roll back to the
previous OpenAB Codex image tag; existing Codex credentials and session data
remain under `/home/node/.codex/`.

For preview-image validation, mode-matrix checks, evidence reporting, and
post-merge rollout, follow [Canary Testing Pull Requests](canary-tests.md).

### Persisted Paths (PVC)

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `/home/node/.codex/auth.json` | Codex login credentials |
| `/home/node/.codex/config.toml` | Codex CLI settings and feature flags |
| `/home/node/.codex/sessions/` | Session history |
| `/home/node/.codex/generated_images/` | Built-in image generation outputs |
| `/home/node/.codex/skills/` | User-created Codex skills |

## Image Generation

Codex built-in image generation uses the **`gpt-image-2`** model under the hood.
It is controlled by the Codex CLI feature flag `image_generation`. Enable it
once inside the pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/openab-codex -- \
  codex features enable image_generation
```

This writes the following to `/home/node/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[features]
image_generation = true
```

You can verify it with:

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/openab-codex -- \
  codex features list | grep image_generation
```

Generated images are saved by Codex under
`/home/node/.codex/generated_images/...`. If the user needs a stable path, ask
Codex to copy the selected output into `/home/node`, for example
`/home/node/sky-birds.png`.

> Note: Codex image generation may return a model-native size rather than the
> exact dimensions requested in the prompt. If exact dimensions matter, resize
> only when the user explicitly asks for it.

### Quick Imagegen Smoke Test

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/openab-codex -- \
  codex exec \
    --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
    --enable image_generation \
    --skip-git-repo-check \
    -C /home/node \
    "Use the imagegen skill and the built-in image_gen tool. Generate a simple image of birds flying across a bright sky. Save or copy the final PNG to /home/node/sky-birds.png. Report the output path and dimensions."
```

Then check for output:

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/openab-codex -- \
  sh -lc 'ls -lh /home/node/sky-birds.png /home/node/.codex/generated_images/*/* 2>/dev/null | tail'
```

## Sending Generated Images Back to Discord

OpenAB streams text over ACP only. It does **not** relay image attachments from
Codex back to Discord. To send a generated image, Codex must call the Discord
REST API directly. See [sendimages.md](sendimages.md) for the full protocol.

The agent should:

1. Read `thread_id` from OpenAB's `<sender_context>` and use it as the Discord
   target channel. If `thread_id` is absent, fall back to `channel_id`.
2. Upload the file with `POST /channels/{id}/messages` using multipart form
   data.
3. Read the token from `DISCORD_FILE_BOT_TOKEN` if available, otherwise
   `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`.

Example upload from inside the pod:

```bash
THREAD_ID="1499442140172910654"
IMAGE="/home/node/sky-birds.png"

curl -X POST "https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/${THREAD_ID}/messages" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot ${DISCORD_FILE_BOT_TOKEN:-$DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}" \
  -F "content=Here is the generated image" \
  -F "files[0]=@${IMAGE}"
```

### Agent Environment for Uploads

The Discord bot token configured under `[discord]` is consumed by OpenAB itself.
For safety, OpenAB clears the inherited environment before spawning the agent and
only passes variables listed in `[agent].env`. If Codex should upload images
itself, explicitly expose an upload token to the agent:

```toml
[agent]
# command defaults from the image's OPENAB_AGENT_COMMAND
# Only override if you need non-default behavior
env = { DISCORD_FILE_BOT_TOKEN = "${DISCORD_FILE_BOT_TOKEN}" }
```

For production, prefer a dedicated "File Deliverer" Discord bot with only
`Send Messages`, `Send Messages in Threads`, and `Attach Files` permissions.
For small personal deployments, using the same bot token is simpler but gives
the agent the same Discord permissions as the main OpenAB bot.

## Recommended Skill

For repeated image requests, save the imagegen + Discord upload workflow as a
Codex skill under `/home/node/.codex/skills/`, for example:

```text
/home/node/.codex/skills/discord-imagegen-deliver/
+-- SKILL.md
`-- scripts/
    `-- send-discord-image.sh
```

The skill should instruct Codex to:

- Use the built-in `imagegen` skill and `image_gen` tool for raster images.
- Keep the generated image size as-is unless the user explicitly asks for
  resizing.
- Copy the selected file from `/home/node/.codex/generated_images/...` to a
  stable path under `/home/node`.
- Upload it to `thread_id` or `channel_id` using the Discord REST API.
- Avoid printing token values.

Example user prompt after creating such a skill:

```text
Use $discord-imagegen-deliver to generate a warm hand-painted sky with birds and send it back to this Discord thread.
```

## Direct Codex CLI Approval Policy & Auto-review

The settings in this section apply to direct Codex CLI commands such as
`codex exec`. For OpenAB ACP turns, select an ACP mode as described in
[ACP Modes and Migration](#acp-modes-and-migration); the adapter supplies the
turn's sandbox and approval policy.

Codex separates **when** to ask for approval (`approval_policy`) from **who**
reviews the request (`approvals_reviewer`):

| Key | Valid values | Purpose |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `approval_policy` | `untrusted`, `on-failure` (deprecated), `on-request`, `granular`, `never` | When Codex must request approval before acting |
| `approvals_reviewer` | `"user"` (default), `"auto_review"` | Who handles the approval — human or GPT-5.4 Thinking reviewer |

For unattended direct CLI commands, **Auto-review is the recommended mode**.
OpenAB agents run as long-lived background processes with no human watching the
terminal, so manual approval is impractical and `"never"` removes all
guardrails.

Enable Auto-review in `/home/node/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
# Full recommended config for OpenAB agents
sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"
approval_policy = "on-request"
approvals_reviewer = "auto_review"

[features]
image_generation = true
```

> `sandbox_mode`, `approval_policy`, and `approvals_reviewer` are **top-level**
> keys in `config.toml`, not under a `[sandbox]` section. Codex silently ignores
> them if nested.

Or seed the config into the running pod's PVC with `kubectl cp` (writable,
persists across restarts):

```bash
kubectl cp config.toml <pod-name>:/home/node/.codex/config.toml
kubectl rollout restart deployment/openab-codex
```

> **Do not mount a ConfigMap directly to `/home/node/.codex/config.toml`.**
> ConfigMap mounts are read-only — Codex cannot write back to them (e.g.
> `codex features enable` will fail with permission denied). Always use
> `kubectl cp` to seed config onto the PVC, which remains writable at runtime.

### What Auto-review does

- Approves ~99% of legitimate out-of-sandbox actions automatically.
- Blocks actions that could exfiltrate data, expose secrets, delete data, or
  weaken security settings.
- When it rejects an action, it gives the agent a rationale so Codex can find a
  safer alternative (succeeds >50% of the time without human input).
- Stops the trajectory after repeated denials to prevent gaming.

### Limitations

Auto-review is **not** a security guarantee. It can be misled by adversarial
inputs and cannot detect a model that hides malicious intent within the sandbox.
Treat it as a strong default, not a replacement for network-level controls and
secret management.

For more details, see the [OpenAI Alignment Blog post on Auto-review](https://alignment.openai.com/auto-review).

## Troubleshooting

### `bwrap: No permissions to create a new namespace`

Some Kubernetes environments do not allow unprivileged user namespaces, which can
block Codex's default sandbox when running nested `codex exec` commands. For
manual smoke tests inside an already isolated pod, use:

```bash
codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox ...
```

Do not use this flag on an untrusted host.

### `bubblewrap is unavailable: no system bwrap was found on PATH`

Codex's Linux sandbox modes (read-only / workspace-write) rely on `bwrap`
(bubblewrap) to create an inner sandbox. If the runtime image does not include
bubblewrap, even basic commands like `pwd` or `ls` will fail before execution
with this error.

This commonly happens in OpenAB deployments where Codex already runs inside an
isolated container or VM — the outer runtime provides the desired isolation, so
the inner sandbox is redundant.

**For ACP sessions**, set `agent-full-access` through
`[pool].default_config_options` as described in
[ACP Modes and Migration](#acp-modes-and-migration).

**For direct Codex CLI commands**, disable Codex's inner sandbox when the outer
OpenAB runtime already provides isolation:

```toml
# /home/node/.codex/config.toml
sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"
approval_policy = "on-request"
approvals_reviewer = "auto_review"
```

> `sandbox_mode`, `approval_policy`, and `approvals_reviewer` are **top-level**
> keys in `config.toml`. A `[sandbox]` section header is silently ignored by
> Codex 0.137+ — verified empirically: with the nested form in place, `codex
> exec` still fails with `bwrap: No permissions to create new namespace`; moving
> the same keys to the top level makes `codex exec` report
> `sandbox: danger-full-access` and run.

> **Do NOT pair `danger-full-access` with `approval_policy = "on-request"` and
> `approvals_reviewer = "user"` on an OpenAB deployment.** Without auto-review,
> `on-request` pauses each tool call to wait for an interactive human approval,
> and OpenAB agents have no terminal attached — every tool call hangs in
> `in_progress` until OpenAB's inactivity timeout fires. Use
> `approvals_reviewer = "auto_review"` (recommended, see
> [§Direct Codex CLI Approval Policy](#direct-codex-cli-approval-policy--auto-review)) or
> `approval_policy = "never"` for trusted and already-isolated pods (`"never"`
> removes all per-call guardrails — the outer pod isolation is the only
> remaining boundary).

Or launch with:

```bash
codex --sandbox danger-full-access
```

Or seed via `kubectl cp` (see [above](#direct-codex-cli-approval-policy--auto-review) for why
ConfigMap mounts should not be used for `.codex/config.toml`):

```bash
kubectl cp config.toml <pod-name>:/home/node/.codex/config.toml
kubectl rollout restart deployment/openab-codex
```

> **Important:** `danger-full-access` disables only Codex's *inner* sandbox. It
> does **not** remove the outer OpenAB container/VM isolation. The agent remains
> confined by the runtime's own security boundary. Ensure the outer runtime is a
> non-privileged container (no `--privileged` flag or excessive capabilities) for
> this security model to hold.

### Imagegen appears to hang

Check whether an image was generated even if the CLI has not returned yet:

```bash
find /home/node/.codex/generated_images -type f -name '*.png' -printf '%T@ %p %s\n' | sort -n | tail
```

If a file exists, copy it to a stable path and upload it manually with the
Discord API command above.

### No image upload appears in Discord

Verify the agent can see an upload token:

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/openab-codex -- \
  sh -lc 'test -n "$DISCORD_FILE_BOT_TOKEN$DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" && echo token-present || echo token-missing'
```

Also confirm the bot has `Send Messages`, `Send Messages in Threads`, and
`Attach Files` permissions in the target channel or thread.
