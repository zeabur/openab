//! Session-aware in-process capability sources for the OAB MCP Facade.
//!
//! The facade's catalog historically had one origin: downstream MCP servers
//! from `mcp.json` (host-level — every connected client sees the same
//! catalog). Some capabilities are **session-bound** instead: they must be
//! routed to the chat session that owns them (e.g. browser control, where
//! `browser.click` must reach *that conversation's* browser tab, #1447).
//!
//! This module adds the second origin:
//!
//! - [`CapabilitySource`] — an in-process provider registered at facade
//!   construction (no `mcp.json` entry, no extra listener, no subprocess).
//!   Sources receive an optional [`SessionCtx`] on every call.
//! - [`SessionTokens`] — the broker↔facade contract for identity: the broker
//!   mints one opaque token per agent session (written into that agent's MCP
//!   client config as an `Authorization: Bearer` header) and revokes it on
//!   session evict. The facade resolves the header back to a [`SessionCtx`]
//!   per request via the HTTP parts rmcp injects into request extensions.
//!
//! Anonymous clients (no/unknown token) keep working unchanged: they see the
//! host-level catalog plus any sources with `requires_session() == false`.
//! Session-bound sources are invisible to them — discovery and execution
//! both gate on a resolved context, so there is no "visible but always
//! fails" surface.
