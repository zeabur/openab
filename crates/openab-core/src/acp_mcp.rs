//! Agent-facing wiring for MCP-over-ACP browser control (feature `acp-mcp`).
//!
//! The module name is historical. It no longer hosts a proxy: the per-session loopback MCP
//! server, its bearer and its per-session config rewrite were removed along with the stdio
//! bridge, leaving the OAB MCP Facade as the only way an agent reaches browser tools.
//!
//! What remains is the seam between core and the colocated agent CLI:
//!
//! - [`report_facade_status`] — startup report of whether browser control is on.
